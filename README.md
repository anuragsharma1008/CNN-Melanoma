# CNN-Melanoma
This CNN model Evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma (a type of skin Cancer)
# Project Name
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
- Application of CNN Techniques
- By this project, we can identify the nature of disease only by seeing the image
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


## Conclusions
1. As the training accuracy increases linearly over time, where as the validation accuracy increases in training process.
2. As the training loss decreases with epochs the validation loss also decreases.
3. The plots show that gap between training accuracy and validation accuracy have decreased significantly from previous model, and it has achieved around 75% accuracy on the validation set.
4. The difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is very less
5. The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters


## Technologies Used
1. pathlib
2. tensorflow
3. matplotlib & pyplot
4. numpy & pandas 
5. keras
6. layers
7. Sequential from tensorflow.keras.models
